DESCRIPTION ABOUT TASK : In this project, we aim to design a simple embedded system that can read temperature values from a sensor and display them either on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or on the Serial Monitor of the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
IN THIS TASK WE USE COMPONENTS LIKE - Arduino Board – The microcontroller platform (Arduino Uno, Nano, or Mega) acts as the brain of the system. It reads sensor data and controls the display.
- Temperature Sensor – Common choices include:
- LM35: An analog sensor that outputs voltage proportional to temperature.
- DHT11/DHT22: Digital sensors that provide both temperature and humidity.
- DS18B20: A digital sensor with high accuracy and one‑wire communication.
- LCD Display (16x2) – Used to show the temperature values in real time. If connected via an I2C module, wiring is simplified.
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires – For easy circuit assembly.
- Power Supply – Usually provided through the Arduino’s USB connection.
WE USE SOFTWARE ARDUINO IDE
WE CAN USE THIS IN VARIOUS APPLICATIONS LIKE - Basic weather stations
- Room temperature monitoring
- Educational demonstrations of sensor interfacing
- IoT projects when combined with Wi‑Fi modules
